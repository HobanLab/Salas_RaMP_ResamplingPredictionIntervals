## READING IN THE GENIND FILE ## 
# Change the filepath below to the filepath for your particular system
QUAC.MSAT.filepath <- "C:/Users/gsalas/Documents/resampling_CIs/Code/Datasets/QUAC_wK_allpop_clean.gen"

# QUESTION 1: What does the ncode argument signify? How can you find out?
  # Number of characters used to code an allele. Information on ncode can be found on the help tab by typing ?read.genepop
QUAC.MSAT.genind <- read.genepop(QUAC.MSAT.filepath, ncode = 3)

# "G" means garden, and the "W" means wild
QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop
# rename the populations to be "garden" or "wild" based on the G or W in the current string
# Correct garden popNames
levels(QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop)[grep(pattern = "QAc-G-", levels(QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop))] <-
  rep("garden", length(grep(pattern = "QAc-G-", levels(QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop))))
# Correct wild popNames
levels(QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop)[grep(pattern = "QAc-W-", levels(QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop))] <-
  rep("wild", length(grep(pattern = "QAc-W-", levels(QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop))))
# Recall the populations, to make sure they look better
QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop

## BUILDING THE ALLELE FREQUENCY VECTOR ##
# familiarize yourself with the parts of a genind object by looking at the printed output:
QUAC.MSAT.genind

# QUESTION 2: What are the rows of the genind@tab object? What are the columns?
  # the rows of the genind@tab object are individuals and the columns are alleles. 
  # this is shown by the printed output of the genind object.
  # the basic content of the printed output shows that the @tab consists
  # of a matrix (449 x 182) which corresponds with the same numbers above the basic
  # content section which explicitly states 449 individuals and 180 alleles. 
QUAC.MSAT.genind@tab

# All individuals
# QUESTION 3: How many copies of the allele PIE125.154 are found in this set of Q. acerifolia individuals?
  # 79 copies of the allele are found throughout this population.
  # Sum of the copies of the alleles can be found by using the sum() function 
  # for the required set of QUAC individuals and by also ensuring that all NA values are removed 
  # setting the na.rm logical statement to TRUE. 
sum(QUAC.MSAT.genind@tab[,"PIE125.154"], na.rm = TRUE)

# QUESTION 4: What's the frequency of PIE125.154 (A1Frequency=A1Copies/(Nâˆ—2))
  # the frequency of PIE125.154 is 0.08797327 represented as a proportion.
  # this is calculated by the quotient of the sum of all the allele copies for PIE125.154
  # over the total individuals in the population (# note: nrow and nIND print the same output):
sum(QUAC.MSAT.genind@tab[,"PIE125.154"], na.rm = TRUE)/(nInd(QUAC.MSAT.genind)*2)
                                                         
# QUESTION 5: What would you use to obtain all of the allele frequencies?
  # To obtain  the frequencies for each allele, it is necessary to calculate the sum of the 
  # copies across all individuals (using colSums() within QUAC.MSAT.genind@tab 
  # and ensuring NA values are removed by setting the na.rm logical statement to TRUE)
  # over the total individuals in the population.
(colSums(QUAC.MSAT.genind@tab, na.rm = TRUE))/(nInd(QUAC.MSAT.genind)*2)

# QUESTION 6: How many alleles have frequencies which are greater than 10%
  # 39 alleles have frequencies greater than 10%.
length(which(((colSums(QUAC.MSAT.genind@tab, na.rm = TRUE))/(nInd(QUAC.MSAT.genind)*2))>0.1))

# Wild Individuals
wildRows <- which(QUAC.MSAT.genind@pop == "wild")
wildSamples <- QUAC.MSAT.genind@tab[wildRows,]
