# Overview
This repository contains code that builds upon Quercus_IUCN_samp_sims, a previous simulation project by Kaylee Rosenberger. The goal of this subproject is to assess how much influence variation has on guidelines for minimum sample sizes required to maintain genetic diversity of various ex situ oak collections. In this subproject, we calculated 95% confidence intervals around minimum sample sizes required for 95% allelic representation across 1000 replicates for 14 IUCN red list endangered oak species. By calculating the width of the confidence intervals, the confidence of the guidelines can be quantitatively determined.

## Datasets
The file in this folder contains the dataset used to calculate the confidence intervals and confidence interval widths for each of the 14 species.
